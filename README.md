# CodingGuidelines
List of mistakes I've made, how I've learned from them, and how to prevent them in the future.

I know [https://refactoring.guru] exists, but I'd like to learn this stuff myself. And writing down helps me a lot with that. Also this might be a more basic approach where I find myself making mistakes, and documenting this allows myself to learn from them.
